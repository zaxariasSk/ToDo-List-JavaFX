## General info
This project is a simple To-Do list using JavaFX gui technology.
The user can create and save his own to-do list of tasks he has to do. 
He can also set a title for the list,
name his tasks and set a dead line for his tasks.
These functionalities are available by a GUI created using JavaFX.

## Usage
